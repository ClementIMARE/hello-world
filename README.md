# hello-world
Hello World, that's my first project on Github. 

Well hello,

I'm definitely not familar with this website but I have to use it for school projets.
So I have no choice.

I am actually reading the tutorial to get familiar with Github.
Btw, I have absolutely no idea about what I'm writing.
